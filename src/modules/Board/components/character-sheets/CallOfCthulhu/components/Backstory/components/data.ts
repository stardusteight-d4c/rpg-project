# Headers

Markdown is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn\’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type — just the essentials, using keyboard symbols you already know.
We can add various levels of headers to our markdown document by using the hash symbol (#). Here is the syntax:

\`\`\`
# Header 1 
## Header 2 
### Header 3
\`\`\`

# Header 1 
## Header 2
### Header 3

# Bold
